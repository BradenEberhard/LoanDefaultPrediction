I should have been updating this as i went but didn't and all of my methods are in here. I tried several different approaches. Originally, I coded up a classic feed forward network with a few layers and simply stuck -1 into all missing values. However I didn't see a lot of great results. I think this is due to the independence of each feature along with the number of features and the fact that 90% of labels are 0. In fact my issue was that almost immediately my model had a mode collapse and just gave me 0s on everything. However this is still my highest scoring entry at 0.83. I also tried making a classifier first to predict 0 or >0 which still collapsed. oversampling worked to prevent mode collapse but gave me less accurate results. I then created an AE and used Dr. Heaton's cleaned dataset condensing down to 75 nodes which got me a score of .85. I also tried using NMF which resulted in a score of .98. If I ever come back to this I could improve it by trying ICA and different number of components/nodes. also playing around with different models, making and ensemble etc.
